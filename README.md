# mediawiki-plugins
This project contains a set of plugins for Mediawiki.

## Repositories of the Submodules

Several Mediawiki plugins have their own Git repository:
* [CrossReference](https://github.com/gallandarakhneorg/mediawiki-crossreference)

## Low Development Rate

As the original author of the different Mediawiki extensions in this repository, I cannot work on updates and bug
fixes for the lastest versions of Mediawiki, because it is outside the scope of my current professional activities.

I have decided to limit my contributions to the mediawiki-plugins to bug fixes that do not require extensive tests on a
runnable instance of Mediawiki.

Nevertheless, you are welcome to contribute by submitting your pull requests.

St√©phane.
