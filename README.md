Plugins for Mediawiki


As the original author of the different Mediawiki extensions in this repository, I cannot work on updates and bug
fixes for the lastest versions of Mediawiki, because it is outside the scope of my current professional activities.
I have decided to limit my contributions to this projects to bug fixes that do not required extensive tests on a
runnable instance of Mediawiki.

Nevertheless, you are welcome to contribute by submitting your pull requests.

St√©phane.
